### Accessibility

In order to make this workshop accessible to researchers from various underdeveloped and developing countries, we have taken care of the following: - 

* We have requested Galaxy community stakeholders to provide special cloud space on https://usegalaxy.org/
* To take care of the bandwidth issues, we have requested Galaxy Community to provide small test data sets for analysis.
* The workshop will be conducted on the Zoom online meeting platform and the login details have been shared with the selected participants.
* Materials will be provided in advance of the workshop in PDf as well as MS Word format.
* Users have been shared with the introductory videos related to login and access to the Galaxy server
* PowerPoint slides have also been shared among the participants.

If we can help to make learning easier for you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, lactation facilities) please get in touch (using contact details below) and we will attempt to provide them.

We are dedicated to providing a positive and accessible learning environment for all.
Please notify the instructors in advance of the workshop if you require any accommodations or if there is anything we can do to make this workshop more accessible to you.
